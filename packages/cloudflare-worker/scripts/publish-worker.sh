#!/bin/bash
# Production worker release pipeline. Invoked by semantic-release via
# `npm run publish:worker` on each tagged release.
#
# Order is intentional:
# 1. Build + verify e2b template FIRST. If the template can't even boot, we
#    don't want a worker that depends on it going live.
# 2. Upload secrets BEFORE deploy (Wrangler ignores absent secrets at deploy
#    time but the new worker code references them at first request).
# 3. Deploy the worker.
# 4. Smoke-test the deployed worker with retry-with-backoff for edge propagation.
#
# Required env vars (set by semantic-release / release.yml):
#   CLOUDFLARE_TURN_API_TOKEN, GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET, E2B_API_KEY,
#   CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID (the latter two consumed by wrangler).
