# CLAUDE.md

This file covers the browser application in `packages/webapp/`. Keep extension-only behavior in `packages/chrome-extension/CLAUDE.md` and runtime/server details in the float-specific package guides.

## Scope

`packages/webapp/src/` contains the browser app core: VFS, shell, git, CDP, tools, providers, skills, scoops, and the UI.

## Architecture

### Layer Stack

```text
Virtual Filesystem (fs/) → RestrictedFS → Shell (shell/) + Git (git/)
  → CDP (cdp/) → Tools (tools/) → Core Agent (core/)
    → Scoops Orchestrator (scoops/) → UI (ui/)
      → consumed by node-server and chrome-extension floats
```

### Data Flow

```text
User → ChatPanel → Orchestrator → ScoopContext.prompt() → pi-agent-core → LLM API
  → tool calls → RestrictedFS / WasmShell / BrowserAPI
  → results → agent loop → UI updates / scoop routing
```

## Key Subsystems

### Kernel Host

- Path: `packages/webapp/src/kernel/`
- `host.ts` — `createKernelHost(config)` factory. Single boot sequence shared by the offscreen document (extension), the standalone DedicatedWorker, and tests: orchestrator + lick-manager + agent-bridge + tray subs + cone bootstrap + BshWatchdog + `/proc` mount. Returns `{ orchestrator, browser, bridge, lickManager, sharedFs, processManager, dispose }`. In non-extension floats the host also opens the `/licks-ws` bridge (`scoops/lick-ws-bridge.ts`) so the node-server's `/api/webhooks`, `/api/crontasks`, `/api/tray-status`, and inbound webhook/handoff routes reach the worker-side `LickManager`.
- `kernel-worker.ts` — DedicatedWorker entry. The standalone path defaults to this since the inline orchestrator path was removed; `?inline=1` no longer exists.
- `process-manager.ts` — `ProcessManager` tracks every long-running async unit: scoop turns, tool calls, shell execs, jsh/python scripts. Pids are uint32 from 1024+; `signal(pid, sig)` honors SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGKILL/SIGSTOP/SIGCONT (SIGKILL escalates uncatchably).
- `proc-mount.ts` — read-only `procfs`-shaped view, mounted at `/proc` via `vfs.mountInternal` (scoop-invisible, not persisted). `cat /proc/<pid>/{status,cmdline,cwd,stat}` works from any panel terminal.
- `realm/` — generalized hard-killable runner for `node` / `.jsh` / `python`. `runInRealm({ kind: 'js' \| 'py', … })` spawns a per-task `DedicatedWorker` (standalone JS + both-mode Python) or sandbox iframe (extension JS); SIGKILL → `worker.terminate()` / `iframe.remove()`, exit 137. Kernel-side `realm-host` proxies `vfs` / `exec` / `fetch` RPC over the realm's port so realm code stays sandboxed.
- `terminal-session-{host,client}.ts` — terminal RPC over the kernel transport. Each panel-typed command spawns a `kind:'shell'` process; SIGINT routes to `pm.signal`.
- `remote-terminal-view.ts` — page-side xterm. Pre-intercepts `mount /<path>` so the keystroke gesture can drive `showDirectoryPicker` (the worker has no `window`).

Deep reference: `docs/kernel/process-model.md`.

### Orchestrator

- Path: `packages/webapp/src/scoops/`
- `orchestrator.ts` creates and destroys scoops, routes messages, and manages shared runtime state. Exposes `observeScoop(jid, handler)` for per-scoop event taps used by the agent bridge; observers are dropped defensively by both `unregisterScoop` and `destroyScoopTab`.
- `scoop-context.ts` owns per-scoop prompt execution and filesystem/tool isolation.
- `agent-bridge.ts` wraps the orchestrator into a stable `globalThis.__slicc_agent` surface used by the `agent` shell command. Registers ephemeral sub-scoops with `notifyOnComplete: false` so spawns from any float don't trigger cone turns. Sandbox defaults: `writablePaths = [cwd, /shared/, <scratch>/, /tmp/]`, `visiblePaths = [/workspace/, invokingCwd]` unioned and de-duped; `--read-only` is pure-replace and drops both defaults.
- `skills.ts`, tray files, and scheduler files extend orchestration rather than the UI directly.

### VirtualFS

- Path: `packages/webapp/src/fs/`
- `virtual-fs.ts` provides the POSIX-like filesystem backed by LightningFS/IndexedDB.
- `restricted-fs.ts` adds path ACLs for scoop sandboxes.
- `mount-commands.ts` is the dispatcher (parses `--source` / `--profile` / `--no-probe` etc.); `path-utils.ts` defines path normalization.
- `mount/` holds the backend abstraction: `MountBackend` interface (`backend.ts`), three implementations (`backend-local.ts` wrapping FS Access, `backend-s3.ts` for S3 + S3-compatible like R2, `backend-da.ts` for da.live), the shared `RemoteMountCache` (TTL + ETag, IDB-backed), `signing-s3.ts` (pure SigV4 v4 via Web Crypto, no AWS SDK), `fetch-with-budget.ts` (timeout + retry + abort threading), and `profile.ts` (cred resolution from `s3.<profile>.*` secrets, IMS for DA). Persistence + recovery: `mount-table-store.ts` keys by `targetPath` with a `BackendDescriptor` discriminated union; `mount-recovery.ts` reconstructs backends per-kind on session restore.

### Shell

- Path: `packages/webapp/src/shell/`
- `wasm-shell.ts` hosts the just-bash runtime.
- `script-catalog.ts` is the shared `.jsh`/`.bsh` discovery service; it caches behind `FsWatcher` invalidation and bypasses cache for mounted trees where external changes are invisible to the watcher.
- `supplemental-commands/` contains built-in commands, including `supplemental-commands/agent-command.ts` which forwards `ctx.cwd` as `invokingCwd` and validates `<cwd>` writability via `ctx.fs.canWrite` to prevent nested-scoop sandbox escape.
- `supplemental-commands/tsc-command.ts` is the `tsc` single-file TypeScript transpiler. It uses the lazy `getTypeScript()` singleton in `supplemental-commands/shared.ts` (the bundled `typescript` npm dependency, same shape as `getSqlJs`) so the heavy module only loads on first call and is shared with the `test` command. Supports `tsc [files...]`, `--noEmit`, `--outDir`, stdin → stdout, and walks up from `ctx.cwd` to merge `tsconfig.json`'s `compilerOptions` over the `ES2022`/`ESNext` defaults; cross-file program-level type checking is not wired up.
- `supplemental-commands/test-command.ts` is the `test` runner. Discovers `*.test.{js,ts}` files via a small in-VFS glob walker (default `**/*.test.{js,ts}` rooted at `ctx.cwd`, skipping `node_modules` and dot-dirs), TS-transpiles `.ts` and `.js` sources to CJS through the shared `getTypeScript()` singleton, then runs each file in its own realm via `executeJsCode` so isolation and SIGKILL come for free. The runner is [`tst`](https://github.com/dy/tst) (0 deps, ESM, ~13 KB): the bundled `tst.js` + `assert.js` are imported via `?raw`, transpiled to CJS once per process, and stitched into each per-file runner as IIFEs that expose `__tst` / `__tst_assert_exports` as locals — user `import test from 'tst'` calls are rewired through an in-realm `__tstReq` shim so the realm's `require()` pre-fetch never round-trips to esm.sh. Reporters: `tap` (default) → tst `tap`, `--reporter=spec` → tst `pretty`. Fork mode is intentionally disabled (the worker_threads / fs / path dynamic imports inside `runForked` are stubbed at harness build time).
- `supplemental-commands/esbuild-command.ts` is the `esbuild` bundler / transpiler. The heavy `esbuild.wasm` binary (~10 MB) is fetched on demand by `supplemental-commands/esbuild-wasm.ts` (mirrors `ffmpeg-wasm.ts` — Cache Storage-backed dual-mode loader; Node / vitest path skips `initialize` since `esbuild-wasm`'s Node entry rejects `wasmURL`/`wasmModule`/`worker` and lazily spawns its own `node bin/esbuild` child). Supports `--bundle`, `--transform`, `--format`, `--minify`, `--sourcemap`, `--target`, `--loader`, `--outfile`. A `createVfsPlugin(fs, cwd)` plugin routes local paths through `ctx.fs` and bare specifiers through `https://esm.sh/` in an `http-url` namespace so nested relative imports across the URL graph chain correctly. Vitest tests that boot the live WASM service are gated behind `SLICC_TEST_HEAVY_WASM=1`.
- `jsh-discovery.ts` and `bsh-discovery.ts` provide the raw scans used by the shared catalog.
- `vfs-adapter.ts` bridges shell calls into the virtual filesystem and forwards `canWrite` (duck-typed so both `VirtualFS` and `RestrictedFS` back it without branching).

### MCP Servers

- Path: `packages/webapp/src/shell/mcp/`; command in `supplemental-commands/mcp-command.ts`.
- Subcommands: `mcp add <url> <name>`, `mcp list`, `mcp delete <name>`, `mcp invoke <name> [tool] [--flag value]`, `mcp refresh <name>`, `mcp auth <name>` (re-authenticate via silent refresh-token renewal with an interactive popup fallback; `--silent` / `--interactive` to force one path).
- Each registered server is exposed as an `mcp:<name>` OAuth provider (visible in `oauth-token --list`) when the server requires auth.
- `mcp add` auto-writes an alias shim at `/workspace/.mcp/aliases/<name>.jsh` so `<name>` resolves as a top-level command and forwards to `mcp invoke <name>`.
- MCP Apps declared by the server via `apps/list` are materialized as sprinkles under `/workspace/.mcp/sprinkles/<name>/`.
- Registration is lazy: the first subcommand call re-registers all servers from `/workspace/.mcp/servers.json` so providers survive a page reload.

### CDP

- Path: `packages/webapp/src/cdp/`
- `transport.ts` defines the CDP transport interface.
- `browser-api.ts` provides the Playwright-style browser API.
- CLI and extension runtimes supply different transport implementations.

### Tools

- Path: `packages/webapp/src/tools/`
- Active surface is file tools, `bash`, and scoop/nanoclaw helpers.
- Browser automation is intentionally routed through shell commands rather than a separate tool family.

### Tray Sync (multi-browser leader/follower)

- Path: `packages/webapp/src/scoops/tray-*`, plus page wiring in `packages/webapp/src/ui/page-leader-tray.ts` and `packages/webapp/src/ui/page-follower-tray.ts`.
- `tray-sync-protocol.ts` is the **canonical wire format**. The iOS follower (`packages/ios-app/SliccFollower/Models/SyncProtocol.swift`) mirrors a **subset** — federated `fs.*` and follower-originated CDP/tab.open are TS-only. iOS DOES respond to leader-initiated `cdp.request` / `tab.open` (and sends back `cdp.response` / `cdp.event` / `tab.opened`). See `docs/architecture.md` "Multi-Browser Sync (Tray) Architecture" for the matrix, and `packages/ios-app/CLAUDE.md` for the 5-step protocol-update checklist.
- `tray-leader-sync.ts` (`LeaderSyncManager`) — broadcasts agent events, snapshots, scoops list, sprinkle list/content/updates, federated CDP, federated FS; handles inbound requests from followers (snapshot, sprinkle.fetch, sprinkle.lick, scoops.select, CDP/FS routing).
- `tray-follower-sync.ts` (`FollowerSyncManager`) — TS follower used by **both** the standalone browser follower (`page-follower-tray.ts`) and the extension offscreen follower (`packages/chrome-extension/src/offscreen.ts` `joinUrl` branch). Implements `AgentHandle` so a follower's `ChatPanel.setAgent(sync)` forwards user input to the leader instead of a local orchestrator.
- The iOS native follower (`packages/ios-app/SliccFollower/`) is a **separate implementation** of the same protocol — it does NOT consume `tray-follower-sync.ts`. Match its behavior when adding follower-side rendering (e.g., sprinkle handling lives in `AppState.handleDataChannelMessage` + `AppState.fetchSprinkleContent` on the Swift side).
- Sprinkle sync: both the TS browser follower (`SprinkleFollowerController` + `FollowerSyncManager.fetchSprinkleContent`) and the iOS follower (`AppState.fetchSprinkleContent` + `SprinkleWebView`) implement the same chunk-reassemble + waiter-dedup + lick-forward flow. Leader-side wiring lives in `page-leader-tray.ts` (`getSprinkles`, `readSprinkleContent`, `onSprinkleLick`, periodic `broadcastSprinklesList`). The leader pushes `sprinkle.update` payloads when `SprinkleManager.sendToSprinkle(name, data)` runs.
- Leaving a tray: `scoops/tray-leave.ts` exposes `leaveTray()` with a discriminated `LeaveTrayWire` union (offscreen-hook / extension-panel / standalone-worker / standalone-page) — exactly one transport is selected per call. `ui/tray-leave-runtime.ts` houses `performTrayLeave(opts, deps)`, the page-side executor used by both the `slicc:tray-leave` window listener in `main.ts` AND the panel-RPC `tray-leave` op. Result is a discriminated `TrayLeaveResult` (`noop` | `left` | `switched`) so the shell formatter narrows exhaustively. Storage write order is load-bearing: on a leader-restart the storage update happens AFTER `startLeader` resolves — a failed startup rolls back to fully-dormant storage rather than persisting a stale leader-on-failed-worker config. UI surface is the "Stop multi-browser sync" / "Disconnect from leader" button in the avatar popover (`ui/layout.ts`); shell surface is `host leave [--leader <url>]`.
- Re-enabling after Stop: `ui/tray-join-url.ts:computeTrayMenuModel` returns `kind: 'leader-offer'` when both leader and follower are `inactive` (previously `'hidden'`, which removed the entire tray section from the avatar popover and stranded users who clicked Stop). The popover's `appendTrayMenu` renders an "Enable multi-browser sync" button that calls `leaveTray({ workerBaseUrl })` after resolving the worker URL via `resolveTrayWorkerBaseUrl` (so `VITE_WORKER_BASE_URL` and any surviving stored value still win over the dev/prod default — matching `main.ts` and `offscreen.ts` boot resolution). The existing `kind: 'switched'` branch in `performTrayLeave` covers `inactive → leader` without a separate helper, and `resolveAmbientLeaveTrayTransport`'s three ambient transports (extension panel / standalone page / offscreen hook) keep routing identical to the leave path. **Known gap:** the offscreen-side `activeHandle.leader.start()` rejection at `chrome-extension/src/offscreen.ts:497` rolls back to `state: 'inactive'` and only logs to telemetry — the user sees the offer button again with no inline error. Plumbing that signal back to the panel is tracked separately.

### Core Agent

- Path: `packages/webapp/src/core/`
- Built on `pi-agent-core` and `pi-ai`.
- `tool-adapter.ts` bridges legacy tool definitions into the pi-compatible tool layer.
- `session.ts` and UI session storage keep the browser runtime restorable.

### Context Compaction

- Path: `packages/webapp/src/core/context-compaction.ts`
- Handles large-context summarization, image resizing, and overflow recovery.
- When `onMemoryUpdates` is wired on `CompactionConfig` (cone only — see `scoop-context.ts` wiring), compaction makes a second LLM call that shares the same system prompt to extract durable memories. The system prompt embeds the serialized conversation so Anthropic prompt caching hits on the prefix and the memory call is near-free. Memory bullets land in `/workspace/CLAUDE.md` via `orchestrator.appendConeMemory` (the cone-private memory file); the `update_global_memory` tool remains the explicit-edit surface for `/shared/CLAUDE.md`. Memory extraction is best-effort and never blocks compaction.
- `appendConeMemory` is size-bounded by `scoops/cone-memory-budget.ts`: `budget = MEMORY_BASE_CHARS + MEMORY_PER_LOG_CHARS * log2(sessions + 2)` (currently 4000 + 2000 per log2). When a fresh append pushes the file past `budget * MEMORY_OVERSHOOT_RATIO` (1.25), the sink runs an LLM restructure over the `## Auto-extracted` tail only — the user-authored header above the first `## Auto-extracted` heading is preserved verbatim. Concurrent appends are serialized through `coneMemoryChain` on the orchestrator. Restructure failure is logged and the appended file is left in place (next append re-attempts).
- `runOneOffCompactionCall` is the reusable primitive — same shared-system-prompt shape, single call. Used by the "New session" freezer to generate a title and extract memories over the live cone session.

### Frozen Sessions ("New session" flow)

- Path: `packages/webapp/src/ui/session-freezer.ts`, `packages/webapp/src/ui/new-session.ts`
- The avatar-popover "New session" entry and thread-header refresh button both run the freezer over the cone session, then clear only the cone (scoops survive). The freezer writes `/sessions/<timestamp>-<slug>.md` (YAML frontmatter + an HTML-commented `slicc:session-data` block carrying the structured `ChatMessage[]` + a human-readable markdown body) and prepends an entry to `/sessions/index.json`.
- The freezer's memory-extraction step appends bullets to `/workspace/CLAUDE.md` via the VFS-only `appendConeMemoryViaVfs` helper (symmetric path to `orchestrator.appendConeMemory`, same target file). Both the synchronous freeze and the boot-time `pending-enrichment` re-run use this path; `/shared/CLAUDE.md` is no longer touched by the freezer.
- `scoops-panel.ts` renders the index as a frozen-sessions section below the live scoops list (standalone only — extension hides the rail). Clicking an entry reads the archive, parses it via `parseFrozenArchive`, and hands the messages to `ChatPanel.displayFrozenSession` for a read-only render — same affordance as clicking a live scoop.
- Clearing semantics: `OffscreenClient.clearAllMessages()` is cone-only. It awaits the bridge's `clear-chat-ack` before resolving so the panel can `location.reload()` without racing the offscreen agent context (which survives the panel reload in extension mode).

### UI

- Path: `packages/webapp/src/ui/`
- Vanilla TypeScript; no framework.
- `main.ts` boots standalone mode or delegates to the extension offscreen client.
- `layout.ts`, `tabbed-ui.ts`, and `tab-zone.ts` manage the main container model. `Layout(root, isExtension)` constructs the shell; the `isExtension` flag is not styling-only — it toggles scoops-rail visibility, scoop-switcher use, rail full-page behavior, and avatar location. The detached popout mode (see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-13-extension-detached-popout-design.md`) uses `isExtension=false` so a popped-out tab gets the full standalone rail UX, not a stretched side panel.
- `runtime-mode.ts` defines `UiRuntimeMode` (`'standalone' | 'extension' | 'electron-overlay' | 'extension-detached'`) — `resolveUiRuntimeMode()` inspects `window.location.href` and the extension flag to pick the boot path in `main.ts`.
- `preview-sw.ts` serves `/preview/*` content from VFS and is built as a standalone IIFE.
- **Design-time chat fixture**: load the app with `?ui-fixture=1` (also accepts `?ui-fixture` or `?ui-fixture=true`) to swap the chat view for a synthetic session covering every message variant — user/assistant bubbles, markdown + code blocks, all four tool-call states, the six lick channels, delegation, queued messages, and a streaming tail. Messages live in `chat-fixture.ts` (pure `createChatFixture()`) and persist to a dedicated `session-ui-fixture` id so real scoop storage is untouched; clicking any real scoop cleanly exits fixture mode. Vite HMR picks up CSS changes live against the fixture. When adding new message UI variants, extend `createChatFixture()` and the matching assertion in `tests/ui/chat-fixture.test.ts` so the harness stays comprehensive.

### Skills

- Path: `packages/webapp/src/skills/`
- Discovers install-managed native skills from `/workspace/skills/`.
- Also discovers compatible read-only skill roots under `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` and `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`.

### Sprinkle Rendering

- Main files: `packages/webapp/src/ui/sprinkle-renderer.ts`, `sprinkle-manager.ts`, `sprinkle-discovery.ts`
- `.shtml` files are discovered from the VFS and rendered as persistent panels.
- CLI mode renders fragments directly or full docs in `srcdoc` iframes.
- Extension mode routes rendering through `sprinkle-sandbox.html`; see the extension guide for CSP specifics.

### Dips

- Main file: `packages/webapp/src/ui/dip.ts`
- Hydrates assistant `shtml` code blocks into sandboxed iframes after streaming completes.
- Uses a minimal lick bridge and auto-height reporting.

## Key Conventions

- **Two type systems**: legacy tool definitions in `tools/` and pi-compatible tools in `core/`; bridge them through `tool-adapter.ts`.
- **Logging**: use `createLogger('namespace')` from `packages/webapp/src/core/logger.ts`.
- **Extension detection**: `typeof chrome !== 'undefined' && !!chrome?.runtime?.id`.
- **Dual-mode compatibility**: browser features must work in both standalone/CLI and extension runtimes.
- **Model IDs**: use pi-ai aliases such as `claude-opus-4-6`, not dated snapshot names.
- **Provider composition**: providers are auto-discovered from pi-ai plus `packages/webapp/src/providers/built-in/`; external provider configs live in `packages/webapp/providers/`, and build-time filtering lives in `packages/dev-tools/providers.build.json`.
- **Adobe `X-Session-Id` invariant**: every LLM call to the Adobe proxy must attach the `X-Session-Id` header (`scoops/scoop-context.ts` wires it for both the agent `streamFn` and compaction `headers`). New LLM call sites — direct `streamSimple` / `completeSimple` callers, or pi-coding-agent helpers like `generateSummary` — must attach it explicitly or the proxy session-id grouping breaks. `providers/adobe.ts`'s `ensureSessionIdHeader` is a defense-in-depth net that injects a daily-rotated sentinel UUID and warns when a caller didn't attach one — fix the call site rather than relying on the fallback. See `docs/pitfalls.md` for the full contract, tripwire, and verification SQL.

## VFS API Patterns

- Prefer absolute VFS paths such as `/workspace/...` and `/shared/...`.
- `VirtualFS.create({ dbName, wipe })` is the entry point for isolated testable instances.
- Mounted directories bridge directly to `FileSystemDirectoryHandle`; do not copy large trees into IndexedDB unless you mean to.
- Use `fs.walk()` and the helper utilities in `path-utils.ts` instead of ad hoc path splitting.
- `RestrictedFS` is the correct boundary when code should not see the whole VFS.

## Shell Command Authoring

### `.jsh` commands

- `.jsh` files are JavaScript shell scripts discovered anywhere on the VFS.
- Command name is the basename without `.jsh`.
- `packages/webapp/src/shell/script-catalog.ts` shares discovery across `WasmShell`, `which`, and other lookup paths. Raw scanning still comes from `jsh-discovery.ts`, which scans `/workspace/skills` first, then the wider VFS.
- Scripts run in an async wrapper: prefer top-level `await` and always `await fs.*` operations.
- Stdin from upstream pipelines is fully buffered (no streaming) and exposed via `process.stdin`. `read()` drains the buffer with Node-like EOF semantics (returns the buffered string the first time, `null` thereafter) and shares that consumed state with `for await (const chunk of process.stdin)`. `String(process.stdin)` is a non-consuming view. `process.stdin.isTTY` is always `false`. `node`'s read-from-stdin branch (when stdin is the script source) hands the inner script an empty stdin so it can't read its own source. Stdin is intentionally NOT exposed as a top-level identifier so user scripts can keep declaring `const stdin = …` without colliding.

### `.bsh` browser scripts

- `.bsh` files are JavaScript browser-navigation helpers that run in the **target browser page context** via CDP `Runtime.evaluate`.
- Scripts have access to `document`, `window`, and all page globals — NOT `process`/`fs`/`exec()`.
- Discovery roots are `/workspace` and `/shared`.
- Filename controls hostname matching:
  - `-.okta.com.bsh` → `*.okta.com`
  - `login.okta.com.bsh` → exact host match
- Optional `// @match` directives in the first 10 lines narrow matching further.
- `BshWatchdog` uses `ScriptCatalog` for matching and reads script content from VFS before evaluating it in the target page via CDP.

## Secret-Aware Fetch Proxy

The webapp consumes `@slicc/shared-ts` for secret masking primitives. `createProxiedFetch()` in `packages/webapp/src/shell/proxied-fetch.ts` routes agent-initiated HTTP through the fetch proxy. In extension mode, the extension branch is Port-based (`chrome.runtime.connect({ name: 'fetch-proxy.fetch' })`) instead of direct fetch, providing full secret-injection coverage equivalent to CLI mode.

### OAuth flow + page-side bootstrap

- `packages/webapp/src/ui/oauth-bootstrap.ts` is awaited in `main()` before the kernel-worker scoops start. For each non-expired account it re-pushes the masked replica; for each expiring/expired one it invokes the provider's optional `onSilentRenew` hook (page context has `window`, so the IMS popup/iframe flow works there). Bounded by a 10s soft timeout to avoid deadlocking the UI on a hung IMS popup. The worker reads the freshly-renewed token from its `localStorage` shim once it boots.
- `provider.onSilentRenew` is the new hook on `ProviderConfig` — providers that support silent renewal implement it (Adobe does via `silentRenewToken`). The worker-side `silentRenewToken` short-circuits with `if (typeof window === 'undefined') return null;` so a stale-token stream attempt from the worker surfaces a clean "session expired" error instead of `window is not defined`.

### Per-provider extra allowed domains

Provider `oauthTokenDomains` is an immutable safe default; users can layer additional allowed domains per-provider:

- Storage: `localStorage["slicc_oauth_extra_domains"]` → `{[providerId]: [domain, ...]}`
- Helpers: `getExtraOAuthDomains(id)` / `setExtraOAuthDomains(id, domains)` / `getAllExtraOAuthDomains()` (sync, page-only) and `setExtraOAuthDomainsAsync(id, domains)` (worker-safe — routes through `panel-rpc` when no DOM, then mirrors the post-write store into the worker shim so same-session reads stay consistent) in `provider-settings.ts`
- Surfaces: panel terminal `oauth-domain` command (worker float — uses the async setter), extension options page "OAuth domains" tab (page float — uses the sync helpers directly)
- Merge: `saveOAuthAccount` concatenates defaults + extras, dedupes case-insensitively (defaults-first order), then pushes the merged list to the fetch-proxy / SW.
- Worker-side write path: the kernel-worker shim's `localStorage.setItem` is page→worker only (no echo-back). Writes from the worker MUST go via `setExtraOAuthDomainsAsync` / the `oauth-extras-set` panel-rpc op, otherwise they're swallowed by the shim Map and lost on reload — see issue #701.

### Shell-env masked secret population

`scoop-context.ts` (agent shell) and `main.ts` (panel terminal `RemoteTerminalView`) both call `fetchSecretEnvVars()` from `packages/webapp/src/core/secret-env.ts` and pass the result as `env`. The function filters secret names to POSIX-valid identifiers (`/^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$/`) so dot-namespaced internal secrets (`s3.<profile>.*`, `oauth.<id>.token`) stay out of `$ENV` / `printenv`.
