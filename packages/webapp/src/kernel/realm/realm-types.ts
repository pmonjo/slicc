 * The realm responds with at most one of `RealmDoneMsg` /
 * `RealmErrorMsg` and then goes silent. Between init and done, the
 * realm may issue any number of `RealmRpcRequest` messages; the host
 * answers each with a matching `RealmRpcResponse`.
 *
 * Termination is uncatchable from the realm's side — the host
 * decides via `Realm.terminate()` (worker.terminate() or
 * iframe.remove()), which is synchronous and doesn't depend on the
 * realm cooperating. SIGKILL semantics are POSIX-style: a runaway
