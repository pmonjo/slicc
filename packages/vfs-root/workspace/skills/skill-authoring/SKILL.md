# Skill authoring

A skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` (and optional companion files) that loads into the agent's system prompt when the description matches the user's intent. This skill is about authoring those folders well.

## Discovery

SLICC discovers three kinds of skill roots:

| Root                                        | Source                               | Mutability                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `/workspace/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`         | Bundled or installed via `upskill`   | Install-managed; you can edit them  |
| `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (anywhere) | Compatibility (Cursor / SuperClaude) | Read-only (discovered, not managed) |
| `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (anywhere) | Compatibility (Claude Code)          | Read-only (discovered, not managed) |

When you create a new skill **for SLICC**, put it in `/workspace/skills/<name>/`. The `.agents/` and `.claude/` paths exist so SLICC can pick up skills authored for other agents without modification — don't create new skills there.

## SKILL.md structure

```markdown
---
name: <slug>
description: |
  Use this when ...
  ... (1–3 sentences explaining trigger conditions, what's covered, and what's
  NOT covered if there's a sibling skill that handles related topics.)
allowed-tools: bash, read_file, write_file, edit_file
---

# Title (matches `name`)

... body ...
```

### Frontmatter fields

- **`name`** — lowercase, kebab-case. Must match the folder name. This is what `skill list` shows.
- **`description`** — the trigger string. The agent uses this to decide whether to load the skill. Get this right; everything else is secondary.
- **`allowed-tools`** — comma-separated list of tools the skill needs. Without this, the agent may load the skill but find it can't execute the steps. Common values:
  - `bash` — almost every skill.
  - `read_file, write_file, edit_file` — for skills that author files (sprinkles, config edits, three-way merges).
  - Omit only for purely informational skills.

### Writing a good description

The description is a trigger, not a summary. It runs through the agent at every turn — too vague and the skill loads when irrelevant; too narrow and it doesn't load when needed.

**Pattern that works**: "Use this when \<user-facing trigger\>. Covers \<topics\>. \[For \<adjacent topic\> use \<sibling skill\>.\]"

Compare:

- ❌ `description: Licks, webhooks, cron tasks, viewing pages/images, screencapture, onboarding`
  Keyword soup. The agent has to guess what "licks" or "screencapture" mean for this user.
- ✅ `description: Use this when setting up event-driven automation in SLICC — webhooks, cron tasks, or filesystem watchers that route events to scoops. Covers webhook, crontask, and fswatch. Read this BEFORE wiring anything that should fire on a schedule, an HTTP call, or a VFS change.`
  Names the user intent ("setting up event-driven automation"), names the commands the agent will reach for, and tells the agent when to load it.

Rules of thumb:

- Lead with **"Use this when..."** or **"Use this whenever..."**.
- Name the **user-facing trigger** (what the user said), not just the implementation.
- If there's a closely-named sibling skill (dips vs sprinkles, mount vs other storage), say which is which inside the description so the agent doesn't load both.
- Multi-line YAML scalars are fine for longer descriptions — use the `|` block style.

## Body conventions

- Lead with one sentence stating what the skill is. No preamble.
- Use tables for option matrices (commands × flags, tradeoffs, etc.).
- Code blocks are bash unless otherwise needed.
- Include a "Don't" or "Common errors" section near the end if the skill is failure-prone — the agent will read it before acting.
- If the skill is large (> ~150 lines), split a reference table or example gallery into a companion `<topic>.md` and have the SKILL.md `read_file` it on demand. The `sprinkles/` skill (style-guide.md) and `dips/` skill (patterns.md) follow this pattern.

## Companion files

### `.jsh` — JavaScript shell scripts

`.jsh` files are auto-discovered as shell commands anywhere on the VFS. **Full reference: `docs/shell-reference.md` (sections "Globals API" and "jsh runtime extensions").**

- **Auto-discovery**: registered as callable commands by filename (without the extension). A skill can ship its own commands by including a `.jsh` next to `SKILL.md`. Priority root `/workspace/skills/` wins on basename collisions.
- **Dual-mode**: works in both the CLI server and the Chrome extension (sandbox iframe). Don't rely on CLI-only Node modules.
- **Top-level `await`**: scripts are wrapped in `AsyncFunction`. Always `await` fs/exec/fetch. Don't use `.then()`.

#### Runtime globals (use these — don't reinvent)

| Global       | Use for                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `process`    | `argv`, `env`, `cwd()`, `exit(code)`, `stdout.write`, `stderr.write`, `stdin.read()`                                                               |
| `console`    | `log`/`info` → stdout, `warn`/`error` → stderr                                                                                                     |
| `fs`         | `readFile`, `writeFile`, `readFileBinary`, `writeFileBinary`, `readDir`, `exists`, `stat`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `fetchToFile` — all paths are VFS, async |
| `exec(cmd)`  | Run any shell command and get `{ stdout, stderr, exitCode }`. Use this to compose with other `.jsh` and supplemental commands.                     |
| `fetch`      | Standard `fetch` routed through SLICC's proxied transport (cookies + CORS handled).                                                                |
| `require(p)` | Pull npm packages from esm.sh (version-pinnable: `require('lodash@4')`). Cached per session.                                                       |

#### Runtime extensions (live — prefer these over hand-rolled equivalents)

The globals below ship in the jsh realm. Full reference: `docs/shell-reference.md` ("jsh runtime extensions"). Use them instead of reimplementing the cross-skill patterns they replace.

- **`process.argv.parseFlags()`** — returns `{ positional, flags, subcommand }`. Replaces the per-skill `--flag=val` / `--flag val` parsing loop.
- **`browser.*`** — `findTab({ domain | urlMatch })`, `ensureTab(url)`, `eval(tab, fn)`, `evalAsync(tab, fn)`, `cookie(tab, name)`, `localStorage(tab, key)`. Replaces shelling out to `playwright-cli tab-list` and regex-parsing its output.
- **`browser.fetch(tab, url, opts)`** — page-context fetch (runs inside the tab's origin, so cookies + same-origin headers are automatic). Replaces the `eval-file` temp-file + double-JSON-unwrap dance.
- **`browser.websocket.on(tab, …).filter({…}).forward({ sink })`** — declarative WebSocket observer with a closed sink set (`webhook` / `scoop` / `vfs` / `log`). **Required** for any new WS-watch use case; do not author page-context `WebSocket.prototype` patches in skill code.
- **`http.client({ baseUrl, token, headers, retry })`** — `get`/`post`/`put`/`delete` with merged headers, lazy token resolution, and Retry-After-aware backoff for `retry.on` statuses.
- **`skill.dir` / `skill.refs` / `skill.assets` / `skill.config()` / `skill.token(providerId)`** — replace the per-skill `process.argv[1]` dirname math, ad-hoc `.config` JSON readers, and bespoke `oauth-token` shell-outs.

Ship a `.jsh` when the skill needs deterministic, parameterizable behavior the agent shouldn't have to re-derive each time (e.g. a `slicc-handoff` helper, a custom diff formatter, a domain-specific lint).

### `.bsh` — browser shell scripts

`.bsh` files auto-execute when the browser navigates to a matching URL:

- **Filename = hostname pattern**: `-.okta.com.bsh` matches `*.okta.com`.
- **`// @match` directive**: restrict to specific URL patterns in the first 10 lines.
- Same execution engine as `.jsh`.

Use `.bsh` for site-specific automations — auto-fillers, lick-emitters, or page transforms that should run whenever the user lands on a particular host.

## Filesystem at a glance

The VFS is stored in IndexedDB; it survives tab closes and refreshes. The `mount` shell command bridges remote storage (local folders, S3-compatible, Adobe DA) into VFS paths — see `/workspace/skills/mount/SKILL.md`.

The VFS supports symbolic links transparently:

```bash
ln -s /workspace/skills /workspace/skill-link    # Create symlink
readlink /workspace/skill-link                    # Read link target
ls -la /workspace/                                # Shows symlinks with -> target
```

`cat`, `read_file`, `write_file` etc. follow symlinks automatically.

**Mount points must be empty.** Mounting over existing files is blocked so built-in skills and scripts stay discoverable. `ln -s` mounted files into the place where you need them.

## Don't

- Don't ship a skill without a description that starts with "Use this when..." — the trigger field IS the skill from the agent's perspective.
- Don't put `name:` in Title Case. Lowercase kebab-case. Match the folder.
- Don't dump shell-command catalogs into a SKILL.md just because they're related — `commands` already lists them. Skills are for **patterns and policy**, not reference material.
- Don't author skills under `.agents/skills/` or `.claude/skills/`. Those roots are for compatibility discovery from other agents.
