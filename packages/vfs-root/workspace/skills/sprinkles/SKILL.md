# Sprinkles

`.shtml` files in `/shared/sprinkles/` become interactive UI panels. Use them for dashboards, forms, and visualizations that persist alongside the chat.

## Two rendering modes

- **Fragment mode** (default): plain HTML fragments injected into the sidebar. Do NOT use `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, or custom CSS — use the built-in `.sprinkle-*` classes. Scripts get a `slicc` bridge object automatically.
- **Full-document mode**: complete HTML documents (starting with `<!DOCTYPE html>` or `<html>`) render inside sandboxed iframes. Use this for complex layouts with custom CSS, sidebars, split panes, modals, or canvas/SVG visualizations. The bridge script is auto-injected — `window.slicc` and `window.bridge` are available. The parent page's S2 theme tokens are injected automatically.

Pick full-document mode when you need custom CSS beyond `.sprinkle-*` classes, complex layouts (sidebar + main, split panes, tabs), or interactive canvas/SVG.

## Layout & viewport

Sprinkles open in **one of four viewport contexts**, and you must design for the narrowest:

| Float                            | Default viewport                       | Multi-column safe?      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Desktop (CLI / Electron) sidebar | Narrow rail (≈ 360 px)                 | No — single column only |
| Desktop full-screen pop-out      | Full window                            | Yes                     |
| iOS / Sliccstart app frame       | Full-width but always single-column UX | No                      |
| Chrome extension side panel      | Narrow (≈ 360 px, fixed by Chrome)     | No                      |

**Default to a single-column layout.** Multi-column layouts (sidebar + main, split panes, three-up grids) only render usefully when the user explicitly pops the sprinkle to full-screen on desktop. They look broken in the rail and on iOS.

If you genuinely need multi-column UI, do all of the following:

1. Build it in **full-document mode** so you can use grid / flex / media queries cleanly.
2. Use `@media (max-width: 600px)` (or similar) to collapse to single column at narrow widths so the sidebar/iOS view still works.
3. Tell the user in your reply that this sprinkle is "best viewed full-screen — pop it out from the rail header."

For dashboards with many widgets, prefer a vertical stack of `.sprinkle-card` blocks over a grid. The card stack is responsive by default and looks good in both rail and full-screen.

## Creating a sprinkle

1. `read_file /workspace/skills/sprinkles/style-guide.md` — **always read first** before writing any sprinkle.
2. **Pick a rail icon** that matches the sprinkle's purpose (see "Sprinkle icon" below). Every new sprinkle MUST declare an icon — the generic Sparkles default is reserved for sprinkles that genuinely have no thematic anchor.
3. `write_file` to `/shared/sprinkles/<name>/<name>.shtml` (follow the style guide templates).
4. `bash` → `sprinkle open <name>`.
5. **CRITICAL: do NOT finish or send a completion message.** You own this sprinkle for its entire lifetime. The cone will send you follow-up instructions (modifications, lick events) via `feed_scoop`. If you finish, you lose your context and cannot handle future work on this sprinkle.

### Updating a sprinkle (when you receive follow-up instructions)

1. Edit `/shared/sprinkles/<name>/<name>.shtml` with the requested changes.
2. Reload: `sprinkle close <name> && sprinkle open <name>`.
3. Do NOT finish — stay ready for more instructions.

### Handling lick events (when the cone forwards a user interaction)

The cone will send you a message with the lick action and your sprinkle name. Only modify YOUR sprinkle — the one matching your scoop name. Process the action and push updates:

- `bash` → `sprinkle send <name> '{"key":"value"}'` to push data to the sprinkle's `slicc.on('update', ...)` handler.
- Or edit the `.shtml` file and reload if the UI structure needs to change.
- Do NOT finish — stay ready for more events.

## Sprinkle icon

Each sprinkle gets its own glyph in the rail so users can tell them apart at a glance. Declare it in the `.shtml`. Three formats, in order of preference:

**1. Lucide icon name** (preferred — covers ~1500 icons from [lucide.dev/icons](https://lucide.dev/icons)):

```html
<link rel="icon" href="music" />
```

Use the kebab-case name from lucide.dev. Common picks: `music`, `code`, `terminal`, `chart-bar`, `chart-line`, `calendar`, `calendar-clock`, `clock`, `image`, `file-text`, `globe`, `book-open`, `compass`, `gauge`, `wrench`, `palette`, `bug`, `flask-conical`, `database`, `cloud`, `package`, `shopping-cart`, `dollar-sign`, `mail`, `message-square`, `bell`, `users`, `user`, `settings`, `sparkles`.

**2. SVG file in the sprinkle's directory** (when no Lucide icon fits):

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/shared/sprinkles/<name>/icon.svg" />
```

Author the SVG with `viewBox="0 0 24 24"`. Keep paths simple — the rail renders at 16×16. **Note**: only Lucide icons inherit `currentColor` from the rail; author-supplied SVGs render through `<img>` (script-disabled), so set explicit colors in the SVG itself.

**3. Inline SVG or data URL** (one-off icons, no extra file):

```html
<link
  rel="icon"
  href='data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="..."/></svg>'
/>
```

**Where to put it**: inside `<head>` for full-document mode, or as the very first element in fragment mode.

**Quoting tip**: when the `href` value contains quotes (inline-SVG data URLs do), wrap the attribute in single quotes: `href='data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg xmlns="...">...'`.

**Fallback**: if the icon spec is missing or unresolvable, the rail uses a generic Sparkles glyph.

## Cone orchestration rules

These are the rules the cone follows when sprinkles are involved. They are absolute.

### Rule 1: One scoop per sprinkle, named identically

Scoop name MUST match sprinkle name. Sprinkle `giro-winners` = scoop `giro-winners`.

### Rule 2: Cone never touches sprinkle files or commands

The cone MUST NOT: write/edit `.shtml` files, run `sprinkle open / close / send`, or handle lick events directly. ALL sprinkle work goes through scoops via `feed_scoop`. **Never handle a lick in the cone.**

### Rule 3: Creating sprinkles

Create a scoop, then feed it a complete, self-contained brief:

```
scoop_scoop("giro-winners")
feed_scoop("giro-winners", "You own the sprinkle 'giro-winners'. Your job:
1. Run: read_file /workspace/skills/sprinkles/style-guide.md
2. Research the last 3 Giro d'Italia winners
3. Pick a rail icon — for cycling, use <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"bike\" /> in <head>. See the sprinkles SKILL.md \"Sprinkle icon\" section for the full list.
4. Write the sprinkle to /shared/sprinkles/giro-winners/giro-winners.shtml
5. Run: sprinkle open giro-winners
6. IMPORTANT: After opening the sprinkle, do NOT finish. Stay ready — you will receive follow-up instructions and lick events for this sprinkle via feed_scoop. Do not send a completion message.")
```

### Rule 4: Modifying sprinkles

Feed the EXISTING scoop that owns it. Do NOT create a new scoop:

```
feed_scoop("giro-winners", "Modify YOUR sprinkle 'giro-winners' at /shared/sprinkles/giro-winners/giro-winners.shtml:
Add an 'Add Previous Year' button with onclick=\"slicc.lick({action: 'add-year'})\"
Then reload: sprinkle close giro-winners && sprinkle open giro-winners
Stay ready for more work.")
```

### Rule 5: Lick events

Forward to the owning scoop, never handle yourself:

```
feed_scoop("giro-winners", "Lick event on YOUR sprinkle 'giro-winners' (/shared/sprinkles/giro-winners/giro-winners.shtml):
Action: 'add-year'
Look up the next previous year's Giro d'Italia winner and update the sprinkle.
Use: sprinkle send giro-winners '<json>' to push data, or edit the .shtml and reload.
Stay ready for more lick events.")
```

## Cheap interactions via `agent`

When a sprinkle button needs to do real work but the owning scoop should NOT be pulled into a turn (it's busy, or the work is purely transactional), route the lick handler through `agent` instead.

Pattern:

1. User clicks → `slicc.lick({action: 'lookup', q: 'foo'})`.
2. Cone sees the lick, forwards to the owning scoop with `feed_scoop`.
3. The scoop's reply runs `agent` against a tight allow-list and writes the result back via `sprinkle send`.

```bash
# Inside the owning scoop's reply to a lick:
result=$(agent /tmp "curl,jq" "Look up '$Q' in <api>, return the price.")
sprinkle send giro-winners "$(jq -n --arg r "$result" '{result:$r}')"
```

Why this matters: a busy scoop that owns a sprinkle can shell to `agent` to handle a click without growing its own conversation. `agent` is **handoff-free** — the ephemeral sub-scoop doesn't notify the cone or the owning scoop on completion. See `/workspace/skills/delegation/SKILL.md` for the full `agent` reference.

This is the difference between "every click adds a turn to your owning scoop" (expensive, drifts) and "every click is a clean transaction" (predictable, cheap).

## Managing sprinkles via bash

- `sprinkle list` — see available sprinkles.
- `sprinkle open <name>` — show a sprinkle in the sidebar.
- `sprinkle close <name>` — remove it.
- `sprinkle send <name> '<json>'` — push data (single-quote the JSON!).
- `sprinkle chat '<html>'` — show inline HTML in the chat (for quick confirmations / choices). Blocks until the user clicks; returns the lick result as JSON. Use when a tool needs user input mid-execution.
- `open /path/to/file.shtml` — also opens as a sprinkle.

```bash
sprinkle chat '<div class="sprinkle-action-card">
  <div class="sprinkle-action-card__header">Deploy to production?</div>
  <div class="sprinkle-action-card__actions">
    <button class="sprinkle-btn sprinkle-btn--secondary" onclick="slicc.lick({action:\"cancel\"})">Cancel</button>
    <button class="sprinkle-btn sprinkle-btn--primary" onclick="slicc.lick({action:\"deploy\",env:\"prod\"})">Deploy</button>
  </div>
</div>'
```

## Bridge API

Available as `slicc` in `<script>` tags and `onclick` attributes:

- `slicc.lick({action: 'refresh', data: {...}})` — send a lick event to the cone (cone routes to the right scoop).
- `slicc.on('update', function(data) {...})` — receive data sent via `sprinkle send`.
- `slicc.name` — the sprinkle's name.
- `slicc.close()` — close the sprinkle.
- `slicc.stopCone()` — stop the cone agent.
- `slicc.readFile(path)` — read a VFS file (returns `Promise<string>`).
- `slicc.writeFile(path, content)` — write text content to a VFS file.
- `slicc.readDir(path)` — list directory entries (returns `Promise<Array<{name, type}>>`).
- `slicc.exists(path)` — check if path exists (returns `Promise<boolean>`).
- `slicc.stat(path)` — get file metadata (returns `Promise<{type, size}>`).
- `slicc.mkdir(path)` — create a directory (recursive).
- `slicc.rm(path)` — remove a file.
- `slicc.screenshot(selector?)` — capture sprinkle DOM as base64 PNG data URL. Note: the screenshot captures a DOM clone using SVG foreignObject. External stylesheets and some computed styles may not be fully reproduced. For best results, use inline styles on elements you intend to screenshot.

**onclick attributes**: always use `slicc` — e.g. `onclick="slicc.lick({action: 'add-year'})"`. The `slicc` variable is automatically resolved per-sprinkle, so multiple sprinkles won't collide. Do NOT use `bridge` or any other variable name in onclick.

**CSS components**: do NOT write custom CSS. Use the built-in `.sprinkle-*` classes: cards, tables, badges, buttons, text fields, progress bars, meters, layout utilities, and more. For inputs use `class="sprinkle-text-field"`, never inline border/padding styles. Run `read_file /workspace/skills/sprinkles/style-guide.md` for the full component reference with markup examples.

## Built-in sprinkles

SLICC no longer ships with a catalog of pre-built sprinkles. The only `.shtml` under `/shared/sprinkles/` is `welcome/`, which backs the inline first-run welcome dip — not a panel sprinkle. **Always create sprinkles from scratch** for what the user is asking for, following the "Creating a sprinkle" flow above. Do not assume a built-in sprinkle name exists.
