/**
 * Pre-flight check that this workspace's own node_modules has been
 * installed before running typecheck/test scripts.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 * Node's module resolution walks UP the directory tree, so when this
 * repo is cloned as a sibling of another slicc checkout (or worktree),
 * `tsc` will silently resolve dependencies from a parent directory's
 * `node_modules` even when the local one is missing or out of date.
 * That can produce TS errors that vanish after `npm ci` — confusing
 * everyone who hits it. This script fails fast with a clear message.
 *
 * The check is intentionally cheap (two `fs.access` calls) and side
 * effect free; it is wired up via `pretypecheck` and `pretest` npm
 * scripts so contributors hit it the moment they run a verification
 * command in a fresh worktree.
