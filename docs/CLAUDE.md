# CLAUDE.md

This file covers the documentation surface in `docs/`.

## Documentation Tiers

| Tier            | Primary file/location              | Purpose                                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Public          | `README.md`                        | User-facing overview and onboarding                                |
| Development     | root and package `CLAUDE.md` files | High-signal developer guidance and package navigation              |
| Agent reference | `docs/`                            | Detailed architecture, commands, patterns, pitfalls, and workflows |

## How to Update Docs

- Update the nearest package `CLAUDE.md` when a change is package-specific.
- Update the root `CLAUDE.md` only for repo-wide navigation, CI gates, or cross-cutting principles.
- Put long-form implementation detail in the appropriate `docs/*.md` file rather than bloating a `CLAUDE.md`.

## Common Destinations in `docs/`

Architecture and build:

- `architecture.md` — detailed subsystem/file maps, layer stack, IndexedDB inventory, tray/sync matrix
- `development.md` — build, run, and debug workflows
- `testing.md` — testing patterns and command selection
- `adding-features.md` — how to add a new shell command, tool, provider, sprinkle, etc.
- `kernel/process-model.md` — kernel-host / process-manager deep reference

Subsystems:

- `shell-reference.md` — shell command reference (authoritative per-command list)
- `tools-reference.md` — agent tool surface reference
- `mounts.md` — `mount` setup for local FS Access, S3/R2/MinIO, and Adobe da.live
- `secrets.md` — secrets storage, masking, and domain-scoped injection
- `oauth-intercept.md` — provider OAuth intercept and silent renewal
- `operational-telemetry.md` — Helix RUM beacons and debug sampling
- `slicc-handoff.md` — external handoff protocol (RFC 8288 `Link` header + `navigate` lick)
- `link-discovery.md` — the standalone `discover` shell command and the `--discover` flag on `playwright-cli` subcommands (`fetch`, `goto`, `navigate`, `open`, `tab-new`); covers RFC 8288 / RFC 9727 parsing, emission, and the SLICC handoff/upskill rels
- `urls.md` — production URL inventory
- `electron.md` — Electron float workflow

Gotchas:

- `pitfalls.md` — runtime and extension gotchas (CSP, dual-mode runtime detection, WASM heap views, etc.)

Other:

- `exploration/` — open design notes (not load-bearing reference)
- `screenshots/` — image assets used by README and other docs

Planning artifacts (`docs/superpowers/specs/`, `docs/superpowers/plans/`) are intentionally **not** kept on `main` — they're scrubbed by the planning-artifact cleanup. Live in branches only.

Keep this directory explanatory, not redundant: prefer one authoritative page per topic and link to it from the shorter `CLAUDE.md` files.
