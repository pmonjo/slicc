![A screenshot of a macOS desktop](docs/screenshots/full-desktop.png)

You are looking at a macOS desktop, with four windows running:

1. Google Chrome, running SLICC as a web application. It shows a Welcome page, a hidden tab with meeting preparation notes that were created by the agent, and a terminal, showing that the operating system is of the unlikely `Mozilla/5.0` kind. What?
2. Slack, the desktop app. Err. Slack the Electron app. It has on overlay injected, showing the ice cream logo asking to join a tray. If you do this, Slack can be remote-controlled by your agent. What the?
3. Sliccstart, the desktop app. It's an actual macOS app, but one that controls browsers, and browsers that prentend to be native apps alike. What the ice cream?
4. An image of an antropomorphized ice cream cone made out of felt and googly eyes. It's sticking out its tongue, half in astonishment, half in anticipation. What the ice cream truck?

If this scares, confuses, or excites you, keep reading.

> A browser-native AI agent for getting practical work done in and through the browser.

SLICC runs in a browser and controls the browser it runs in. It combines a shell, files, browser automation, and multi-agent delegation so you can do real work from one workspace — coding, web automation, authenticated app tasks, and the weird in-between jobs that do not fit neatly inside a chat panel. SLICC can orchestrate multiple browsers, and even some apps through telepathy, making it a powerful hub for your digital work.

- Head over to [releases](https://github.com/ai-ecoverse/slicc/releases) and grab the latest `.dmg` file. No Windows or Linux UI yet
- Or launch it from the CLI today (we also have a Chrome extension)
- Connect other browser windows or Electron apps
- Install skills that teach it how to perform challenging tasks
- Give it practical tools models already know how to use
- Delegate parallel work so tasks get done faster

> Status: active working prototype. The macOS app is the easiest way in today; and we have submitted the extension to Chrome Web Store.

## Why SLICC is different

- **Browser-native, not browser-adjacent.** The agent runtime lives in the browser, and the agent can act on the same browser it lives in. A great mix of power and containment. If you don't like what the AI does, close the browser tab and it's over.
- **A real shell environment.** Many browser agents are constrained by the tools provided to them. SLICC has an almost-too-real shell with commands like `git`, "`node`", `python`, `playwright`, built-in.
- **UI on the fly.** SLICC can generate rich user interfaces on the fly. These can be small visualizations in a chat response, or full-blown web applications that run in a sidebar, or even a separate tab.
- **Built around Skills.** Agents don't suffer from missing capabilities, they suffer from skill issues. SLICC can install native skills into `/workspace/skills`, and it also discovers compatible `.agents` / `.claude` skills read-only across the reachable VFS.
- **More than a coding panel.** Coding is one strong use case, but SLICC is built for practical browser work too: authenticated web apps, repetitive tab work, content operations, debugging, research, and automation.
- **Works across runtimes.** Start in the CLI, run as a Chrome extension, connect multiple tray sessions, or attach to Electron apps with the same core model.
- **Delegates in parallel.** The main agent can spin up isolated sub-agents for task-specific work instead of stuffing everything into one conversation.

## Who it is for

SLICC is for you if:

- you spend a lot of your day in browsers, terminals, and web apps
- you want an agent that can act, not just answer
- you are curious about automation, shell tools, and technical workflows
- you want one system that can span local dev work, browser tasks, and Electron surfaces
- you are an AI/web-dev-adjacent builder, power user, who's comfortable with things being broken from time to time (we are working hard to make this smoother)

## What you can do with it

- **Launch an agent from the CLI and let it work in the browser it controls.** Start one command, open the workspace, and give the agent shell tools, files, and live browser access in one place.
- **Automate repetitive workflows in authenticated web apps.** Use browser automation, page inspection, screenshots, storage access, and scripted tab control where your logged-in browser session already has the context.
- **Hand work off from another coding agent into your live browser session.** Open any URL whose response carries an RFC 8288 `Link` header with a SLICC handoff or upskill rel (the tray-hub `/handoff?handoff=...` / `?upskill=...` endpoint is a convenience) and SLICC prompts you to approve the action inside the Chat tab.
- **Solve technical tasks with practical tools.** Reach for `bash`, `git`, `grep`, `node`, `python`, previews, and browser automation when the job is bigger than text generation.
- **Add visual and file context directly in chat.** Drop images or files onto the workspace, or use the paperclip button. Dropped `.skill` archives still install into `/workspace/skills`.
- **Delegate parallel work to scoops.** Split tasks into isolated sub-agents with their own sandboxes and context, then let the main agent coordinate the results.
- **Turn one-off wins into reusable workflows.** Package behavior as skills, build interactive sprinkles, and react to external events with webhooks and cron-driven licks.
- **Mount your local file system.** By default, SLICC is confined to your browser. But you can ask it to mount folders from your local file system, so it can read and write from there. Mount into an empty path such as `/mnt/myproject` so you do not hide existing skills or scripts.
- **Mount remote storage as if it were local.** Beyond local folders, `mount --source` bridges S3 buckets, S3-compatible services like Cloudflare R2 and MinIO, and Adobe da.live repositories into the same VFS surface. Reads use TTL+ETag caching with conditional revalidation; writes use ETag-conditional PUTs that surface concurrent-edit conflicts as `EBUSY`. Credentials live server-side (`~/.slicc/secrets.env` in CLI, `chrome.storage.local` in the extension via the **Extension options** page) and never reach the agent. After setup: `mount --source s3://my-bucket --profile r2 /mnt/r2` or `mount --source da://my-org/my-repo /mnt/da`. See [docs/mounts.md](docs/mounts.md) for the full guide.

## Getting started

### 1. Quick start with npx

The fastest way to try SLICC — no clone, no install:

```bash
npx sliccy
```

This downloads the latest release, launches Chrome, and opens the workspace. Configure your LLM provider in the first-run settings dialog. Requires Node >= 22.

### 2. Install globally

If you plan to use SLICC regularly:

```bash
npm install -g sliccy
slicc
```

### 3. Run from source (contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai-ecoverse/slicc.git
cd slicc
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

- Optionally pre-configure providers: `cp packages/dev-tools/providers.example.json packages/webapp/providers.json`
- See [packages/dev-tools/providers.example.json](packages/dev-tools/providers.example.json) for the available provider fields.
- For contributor-focused setup details, see [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).

### 4. Chrome extension

The extension runs the same core experience as a Chrome side panel with no separate server process.

```bash
npm install
npm run build:extension
```

Load `dist/extension/` as an unpacked extension in `chrome://extensions`, then open the SLICC side panel.

**Pop out to a full-page tab.** In the Chrome extension, the side panel
header has a "Pop out" button that opens SLICC in a full-page tab with
the standalone split-pane layout. Close the tab to return to the side
panel. State (chat history, scoops, VFS) is shared.

While a detached tab is open, the side panel is disabled globally
(across all Chrome windows) — clicking the toolbar icon focuses the
detached tab. This is intentional; close the tab to restore the side
panel. The optional best-effort SW hard-close of any open side panels
uses `chrome.sidePanel.close` (Chrome 141+). Older Chrome versions
still get full mutual exclusion via `window.close()` from the panel,
the send-path lock, and the non-dismissible overlay.

### 5. Run a second browser

SLICC can mirror itself across multiple browsers, even on other machines:

1. **First browser:** click your avatar in the top-right header and choose **Enable multi-browser sync**. A dialog opens with the sync URL (already copied to your clipboard) and step-by-step instructions. The same dialog has a **Reset URL** button if you want to invalidate the link and disconnect connected browsers. (You can also type `host` in the built-in terminal to print the URL.)
2. **Second browser:** open the account dialog, click **Connect to another browser**, and paste the URL. The "How do I get the sync URL?" hint inside the dialog walks through the same steps.
3. **Leaving the tray:** click the avatar on either browser to open the popover — the tray section now has a **Stop multi-browser sync** (leader) or **Disconnect from leader** (follower) action. From the terminal, `host leave` does the same thing; `host leave --leader <worker-url>` leaves the current role and becomes a leader on that worker.

Both browsers must run the same SLICC version. Once connected, the sessions stay in sync in real time.

### 6. Electron

SLICC can also attach to Electron apps and inject the same shared overlay into their pages. The best way to use it with Electron apps is to use the Join Tray feature, so that the Electron app becomes a remote-controllable target.

```bash
npm run dev:electron -- /Applications/Slack.app
```

For the full Electron workflow, see [docs/electron.md](docs/electron.md).

## Screenshots and proof

## How it works

SLICC shares one core across the CLI, extension, and Electron modes. The browser is not just where you view the product — it is where the agent runtime lives.

- **Browser-first runtime:** the agent loop, virtual filesystem, shell, UI, and tools run client-side.
- **Thin server where needed:** the CLI path mainly exists to launch Chrome, proxy CDP, and bridge the few things browsers cannot do alone.
- **One model across floats:** CLI, extension, tray/follower flows, and Electron all reuse the same underlying system.
- **Cone + scoops delegation:** the main agent orchestrates; sub-agents execute in isolated sandboxes and report back.
- **Skills explain the world to the agent:** don't expect the agent to know everything, ask it to search and install skills that are relevant to the task.

## The SLICC vocabulary and lore

Once the product makes sense, the ice-cream language is easier to enjoy: it maps to real architecture, not just mascot energy.

- **Cone** — the main agent you interact with. It holds the broad context, owns the overall workflow, and delegates work.
- **Scoops** — isolated sub-agents with their own filesystem sandbox, shell, and conversation history.
- **Licks** — external events that wake an agent up: webhooks, cron jobs, and other signals from the outside world.
- **Floats** — normal engineers would call it runtimes, but would normal engineers have come up with this?
- **Tray** — multiple floats can form a tray, a joint session with remote control.
- **Sprinkles** — everything is better with sprinkles: small, optional enhancements you can add on top of the core system.

Why the name? SLICC stands for **Self-Licking Ice Cream Cone**: a recursive system that can help build, extend, and operate itself. A browser agent running inside the browser: that's as self-recursive as tongue-out gelato.

## API Keys and Providers

To use SLICC, you need an LLM provider. SLICC is very much a BYOT (bring your own tokens) affair. We have built-in support for many providers, and these have actually been tested.

- Adobe (for AEM customers. Talk to the team to get enabled)
- AWS Bedrock (because enterprise)
- AWS Bedrock CAMP (this is Adobe-internal. Did I say "because enterprise" already?)
- Anthropic

The other providers are in YMMV territory. Please file an issue if you find them working or broken.

## Secrets

SLICC can safely manage API keys, tokens, and credentials with domain-scoped injection. The agent never sees real secret values — only masked placeholders — and secrets are only injected into requests destined for authorized domains. This protects against prompt-injection attacks that try to exfiltrate credentials.

See [docs/secrets.md](docs/secrets.md) for setup instructions.
